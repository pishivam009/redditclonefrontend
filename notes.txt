npm install --save bootstrap
Bootstrap is added in the list of dependencies in package.json 

Once the bootstrap is installed in our project, we have to inform the CLI to include bootstrap files in the final bundle it creates. 
By default Angular CLI won’t include the bootstrap CSS files in the bundle it creates when running the application.
We can add the location of the Bootstrap CSS inside the “styles” array of the angular.json file.

"styles": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
              "src/styles.css"
            ]
